This is a prototype for next-generation GUI for BleachBit.

This is a video of progress as of October 5, 2024. The major changes are on the right pane, allowing the user to sort and filter the results of the preview or clean. The file results also have a context menu. Thx CrackHub for ideas!

# Known issues

There are many missing features. Most notably, this GUI is not integrated with any cleaners or the file system, and all the information is example data just for show, so it "doesn't do anything."

This is a rough prototype, so expect bugs.

# How to run

The way it runs from source code is similar to regular BleachBit: see [Running BleachBit from source code](https://docs.bleachbit.org/dev/running-from-source-code.html). Linux typically comes with Python and GTK, so simply run `python3 bleachbit_gui.py`. Windows users will need to install Python and GTK: see the link.
